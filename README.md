# Smart CPS Water Tank System

This repository contains the early-stage prototype of a Cyber-Physical System (CPS) based Smart Water Tank Monitoring and Management System. The project explored sensor integration, IoT connectivity, and automated water-level management workflows.  
The initial development was done as part of an early product ideation activity in collaboration with the team at Eshwar Tanks (https://www.eshwartanks.com/).  
Note: The system may have evolved significantly after my involvement.

## Overview

The Smart CPS Water Tank System was intended to test the feasibility of:

- Real-time monitoring of water tank levels  
- Transmission of sensor data using IoT communication protocols  
- Remote visibility through basic dashboards or mobile interfaces  
- Prototype automation logic for pump control  
- Stability and reliability tests in practical environments  

All content in this repository reflects the prototype phase only and is not intended for production deployment.

## Features (Prototype Stage)

- IoT-based communication for transmitting sensor readings  
- Integration of ultrasonic or float sensors depending on the testing stage  
- Concepts for both local and remote monitoring  
- Early automation logic for motor or pump control  
- Modular design for later expansion  
- Documentation from initial testing and validation experiments  

## Tech Stack

- Microcontrollers: Arduino or ESP-based boards  
- Communication: WiFi or MQTT (prototype)  
- Data Processing: Basic calibration and filtering on the device  
- Visualization: Simple interface mockups for monitoring  
- Architecture: Cyber-Physical Systems workflow (perception → transmission → computation → actuation)
